   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TAIL.ai.git
   cd TAIL.ai
   ```

## Development Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Edit `.env` with your configuration:

   - MongoDB connection string
   - JWT secret
   - API keys for AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Other service credentials

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```

### Verify Setup

- Frontend should be running at: http://localhost:3000
- Backend should be running at: http://localhost:8000

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests

Examples:

- `feature/workflow-composer-ui`
- `fix/authentication-bug`
- `docs/api-documentation`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting changes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:

- `feat(workflow): add drag and drop functionality`
- `fix(auth): resolve JWT token expiration issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use functional components over class components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use TypeScript where applicable

### Code Formatting

- **Prettier** is configured for both client and server
- Run formatting before committing:
  ```bash
  # In client or server directory
  npx prettier --write .
  ```

### ESLint

- Follow the configured ESLint rules
- Run linting:
  ```bash
  # In client directory
  npm run lint
  ```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the configured Tailwind setup
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Maintain responsive design principles

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Frontend tests
cd client
npm test

# Backend tests
cd server
npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Include component tests for React components
- Ensure good test coverage for new features

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Test your changes** thoroughly
2. **Run linting and formatting**:

   ```bash
